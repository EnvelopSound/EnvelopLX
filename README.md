# EnvelopLX
EnvelopLX is an interactive lighting application for [Envelop](http://www.envelop.us/). It runs in Processing, built on top of the open source [P3LX](https://github.com/heronarts/P3LX) framework. The system may be controlled directly, or via remote OSC control from the [Envelop for Live](https://github.com/EnvelopSound/EnvelopForLive) devices, which can be composed and sequenced from Ableton.

When connected with an active Envelop server, real-time spatial audio feedback is also available.
